CMU 15418 Assignment 1: Analyzing Program Performance on a Multi-Core CPU
=========================================================================

Please refer to the [course website](http://15418.courses.cs.cmu.edu/spring2016/article/3) for instructions.

# Build on Windows
The assignment starter code can be compiled on both Windows and Linux. Following instructions are specific for running on Windows.
==Platform Requirement
You need Visual Studio 2017 to compile the starter code on Windows. 
You can download Visual Studio 2017 Community here: https://www.visualstudio.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15
## Preparation
You will need Intel ISPC compiler for this assignment. 
1. Download ISPC at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ispcmirror/files/v1.9.1/ispc-v1.9.1-windows-vs2015.zip/download
2. Extract ispc.exe into assignment1\ispc\ directory.
## Run
With ispc.exe at correct location, you can compile and run the assignment using assignment1.sln
## Changing the command line argument to ISPC
If you wish to explore different ISPC command line arguments when compiling an ispc file (e.g. prog3_mandelbrot_ispc\mandelbrot.ispc), you may do so directly in Visual Studio.

1. Right click the ispc source file in Solution Explorer, and select Properties.

2. Ensure "Configurations" and "Platform" are both set to "Active", and change the text in the "Command Line" row.

Note that you'll need the "--arch=x86" argument if you are building 32bit applications (Win32 platform), and the "--arch=x86-64" when building 64bit applications (x64).

# Build on Linux
Instructions for building on Linux is included in the [course website](http://15418.courses.cs.cmu.edu/tsinghua2017/article/3).
